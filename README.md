==========================

C. Trachomatis and E. Coli genome annotation anaylsis


ecoli.annotation and trach.annotation are the original files to be analyzed containing gene annotation data derived from the sequence analysis of each respective bacterial genome.

gpls718project.sql is used to create and instantiate a database that can be used to store the data contained in the annotation files.

db_loader.pl is used to parse the data in the annotation files and load them into the database previously created.

step2.pl is used to extract a specific subset of data from the database using MySQL queries and organize them into an output file with tab-separated values.

step2_output.tsv is the output file generated by running the step2.pl script.

step4.R is used to perform a basic statistical analysis of the data extracted in step2_output.tsv
